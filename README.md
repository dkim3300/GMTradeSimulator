# GM Trade Simulator

An application that allows users to become sports 'General Managers' by creating, trading, re-assign, and viewing the attributes of their players.

**What is it going to be?**

My personal project will be an NHL trade simulator where a "team" (user) will 
submit requirements of a player that meets their needs and wants. Then,  list of players that 
will that meet the user's wants will be shown and also the requirements or assets needed 
for the player to be successfully traded to the user's team. 

**Who will use it?** 

My project will be for any type of person. This can range from a hockey fanatic to 
a person who is just getting familiar with hockey. 

**Motivation for this project?** 

Ever since I was young, I have always been intrigued by NHL general managers 
evaluating players and trading players with other teams. This fascination has 
led me to invest my time into playing fantasy sports, constantly trading players
with the motivation to put out the best lineup for upcoming games. However, the amount
of time spending on looking through each and every player's stats that fit my needs 
takes a long time to do. As a result, I want to use this opportunity to build 
a system that automatically outputs a list of players that meet my requirements and 
estimates the costs required to obtain them.
